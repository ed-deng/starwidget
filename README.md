### Read Here
- As a candidate, you should build a simple widget using React that ** Renders Five stars based on the Grades**. 
- On loading the UI, each star will have a default black color. But when one of them is clicked, colors of the star and its siblings that are to its left should turn to yellow.
- Implement on Hover when the state is default the star needs to fill the color till the state is set. 
- Create a reset functionality to default the state. 
- Additionally, the Grade rating (value) of the current rating should be rendered next to a Current rating text similar to shown in the gif. That means, if the user decides to give a rating of 4 stars, in addition to the changes in color, the user should be able to see the ** Current Ratings : Very Good ** below the stars.
